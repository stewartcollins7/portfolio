### Portfolio Frontend
##### Author: Stewart Collins

This project is the source code for my portfolio website. The idea
is to give people a chance to look at my code and some of the
technologies I am familiar with.

This client side code is stored in a separate repo to the backend code
to ensure they are kept completely independent.

#### Tools/Technologies
    Typescript
    Javascript
    React
    create-react-app (babel,webpack,++)
    material-ui
    npm
